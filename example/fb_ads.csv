711044099385134,106711940790613,Steve Aiken for East Antrim,"New Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken standing in East Antrim 

New Ulster Unionist Party Leader Dr Steve Aiken OBE MLA has been nominated as his party‚Äôs candidate for the General Election in East Antrim.

The 57-year-old, who lives in the constituency, served 31 years in the Royal Navy during which time he commanded nuclear submarines, was made an OBE and was awarded the US Meritorious Service Medal for his military service in the Middle East.   Since his retirement from the Service Steve has been a CEO, before becoming an MLA for neighbouring South Antrim in 2016. 

Steve said:
‚ÄúIt is an enormous privilege to be selected to be the Ulster Unionist candidate in the forthcoming Westminster election.  As well as living in the constituency, I have strong connections with East Antrim - having been educated at Belfast High School, learned to sail at Carrickfergus Sailing Club, with strong family connections to Carrick, and believe strongly it is time that we have a change in who represents us at Westminster.

‚ÄúWe need to give East Antrim the chance to elect an MP who will put the Union first, fight Boris Johnson‚Äôs withdrawal deal and stand up for all the people of East Antrim; regardless of religion, identity, gender or class.

‚ÄúI am standing in East Antrim because I believe in leading from the front.  I want to challenge the sitting MP on policy- and be in no doubt that it was his and the DUP‚Äôs reckless policy which has led to the current mess where the rest of the UK is set to leave the EU with Northern Ireland left behind in a constitutional limbo.

‚ÄúNever has a General Election been more important.  With the outcome so uncertain, it is essential that East Antrim returns an MP who will fight to stop Boris‚Äôs Withdrawal Deal, - who won‚Äôt succumb to the folly of putting a border down the Irish Sea, who will not vote to cap Nurses pay and who will enact legislation to fight the climate emergency-rather than deny its very existence.  

‚ÄúThe Ulster Unionist Party voted, on balance, to remain in the referendum. As a democratic party we recognised the result of that referendum.  However, as a unionist party, right now with Boris Johnson‚Äôs withdrawal deal being the only one on the table, we have to recognise a clear fact ‚Äì if the Conservatives‚Äô deal goes through, Northern Ireland will, well and truly, become a ‚Äòplace apart‚Äô.

‚ÄúI offer pro-Union voters a choice.  A choice between an Ulster Unionist candidate who will offer a positive, progressive vision for unionism, protecting our place within the United Kingdom and the sitting DUP MP who has dropped the ball, allowing a border to be put up the Irish Sea and whose party has dragged the reputation of unionism into the gutter.

‚ÄúWhat drives me is doing what‚Äôs best for my constituents, and trying to make Northern Ireland work again.  We can only do that by changing who represents us at Parliament, and I‚Äôm asking the people of East Antrim to come out and vote for me on the 12th December as the only person who can make that change happen.‚Äù

The UK has just embarked on yet another general election. Once again, the airwaves are full of promises with political parties pledging to spend billions on education, healthcare, and housing. But in a world now dominated by ‚Äòfake news‚Äô we‚Äôre deeply cynical that once the election is over many of them will be forgotten. But maybe we have reason to be more hopeful.

In 2017 a study of 12 European and North American nations found that parties elected to office were likely to fulfil their campaign promises to a considerable extent.

In a similar way it‚Äôs all too easy to be dismissive of the church and cynical about the Good News that Christians are supposed to represent. But listen to these words from Jesus in a declaration about why he had come, ‚ÄòThe Spirit of the Lord is on me‚Ä¶ to preach good news to the poor‚Ä¶ proclaim freedom for prisoners‚Ä¶ recovery of sight for the blind‚Ä¶ release for the oppressed.‚Äô During his life on earth Jesus fulfilled these promises in every way.

Politicians will come and go, making and breaking promises, and then disappearing into history. Jesus, on the other hand, has been keeping his promises for 2,000 years and always will.

WESTMINSTER - (Bywire News) Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday that Britain and the European Union had agreed a ""great"" new Brexit deal but still faced resistance from the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) as he sought support for the deal.

Britain and the European Union have been racing to renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement in time for an Oct. 31 Brexit, but the deal still needs approval from parliament.

""We've got a great new deal that takes back control,"" Johnson said in a tweet.

""Now parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.""

However, the DUP, who have expressed concerns that the Brexit deal could cut Northern Ireland off from Britain in customs and regulatory terms, said there had been no change in their position following the confirmation of the deal.

Earlier the DUP had said it could not support the last-ditch Brexit proposal due to concerns about the issues of customs and consent, adding there was a lack of clarity on VAT (sales tax) arrangements.

""We've got a great new deal that takes back control,"" Johnson said in a tweet.

""Now parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.""

However, the DUP, who have expressed concerns that the Brexit deal could cut Northern Ireland off from Britain in customs and regulatory terms, said there had been no change in their position following the confirmation of the deal.

Earlier the DUP had said it could not support the last-ditch Brexit proposal due to concerns about the issues of customs and consent, adding there was a lack of clarity on VAT (sales tax) arrangements.

The Alliance Party has selected local MLA Paula Bradshaw to contest the South Belfast constituency at the Westminster election as it seeks to build on its status as the largest Remain party in the constituency at this year‚Äôs elections.
 
Ms Bradshaw stated: ‚ÄúThe Alliance Party emerged over 2000 votes clear of any other Remain party in the South Belfast constituency at May‚Äôs local election. Naomi Long‚Äôs victory at the subsequent European Election further demonstrated that we are best placed to build the necessary range of support across the whole constituency to unseat the DUP. Since May, we have double the elected representation of any other Remain party.
 
‚ÄúThis cannot be a tired old Nationalist versus Unionist election. This election must be United Community against Brexit. This is one reason I am proud to designate ‚ÄòUnited Community‚Äô in the Assembly.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúI will also be standing on the Alliance Party reputation for hard work and delivery right across the constituency. On issues ranging from the availability of cancer drugs to HPV vaccines, the Alliance Party in South Belfast has shown an ability not just to talk about things, but to get things done, which have a real impact on people‚Äôs daily lives.
 
‚ÄúSouth Belfast is also an overwhelmingly Remain constituency which is why it swung so heavily behind Alliance at the European Elections. The choice before the public is simple. If they simply do the same the same thing they did in May and vote Alliance, they will elect a United Community Remain MP representative of the whole constituency.‚Äù

Speaking in support of Paula, Alliance Leader Naomi Long MEP said: ‚ÄúIt was clear in May that Alliance has a unique ability to reach across the community, and that by voting Alliance you can get people elected at all levels you represent your views.

‚ÄúI want to tell people in South Belfast that there can be no better person to do that than Paula Bradshaw. You have seen how hard she has worked and the real change she has delivered even without a sitting Assembly, putting shoe leather on the ground and getting your problems solved.

‚ÄúWith Paula‚Äôs focus on detail and her expertise in all areas relevant to Brexit, with two relevant degrees and two decades‚Äô worth of work in and for the community covering the key regulations and funding which will be affected by our future relationship with the EU, I am saying to the people of South Belfast there can be no better person to represent you and to turn up and ensure your interests are protected.

‚ÄúIt is clear the Alliance surge is continuing. So I urge you to get behind Paula and her Alliance team the way you got behind Alliance in May, and you will deliver the same result.‚Äù",,,,2019-09-11T20:42:01+0000,2019-09-14T20:42:00+0000,Mrs Michelle Guy,1000,4999,0,99,https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=2318770378235832

858321497896263,20550602416,Attila the Stockbroker,"Unprecedented, historic scenes in the House last night. Johnson‚Äôs prorogation of parliament at such a crucial time in our history is a tragic act of folly equal to anything Charles I came up with, an act of the most abject cowardice and an insult to our intelligence as a nation. 

But the opposition have played an absolute blinder. As a student of politics it was wonderful to see the legislature seize power from the executive, turn Johnson‚Äôs planned massive, rampant election into an impotent flop and force him to either get a deal or ask the E.U. for an extension.  

In my opinion neither of these were in Cummings‚Äô plans at all: if the law is adhered to and the Brexit communications revealed, I predict they will reveal strategy for an election framed as ‚Äòparliament versus the people‚Äô straddling a chaotic no-deal crash out  - with all the blame shoved onto Johnny Foreigner of course.  

This is now on the back burner and the ball is in Johnson‚Äôs  court. His massive hubris led him to believe Cummings would be able to play Parliament for fools and the strategy would work, but it‚Äôs been torpedoed. Now he has the choice between finding a deal, going cap in hand to Brussels to ask for an extension or breaking the law. 

So what will happen now? Do remember that Johnson‚Äôs lack of principle makes Niccolo Machiavelli look like Thomas Paine, as the infamous pro-Remain essay bears witness. He doesn‚Äôt actually believe in anything at all apart from what is best for Boris Johnson. So my prediction is that he will change tack and go for a deal, with an election message to follow claiming credit for ending the crisis, and since the DUP are out of the equation now he‚Äôs lost his majority I predict he‚Äôll go for the Northern Ireland only backstop option. 

It‚Äôs not unlikely that at the  eleventh hour some kind of deal will be stitched together and we‚Äôll leave the EU without literally falling off the White Cliffs of Dover on October 31st. The alternatives - dying in a ditch, asking for an extension or going to jail - will not appeal to the studiedly scruffy egomaniac one bit.

In that circumstance small businesses, people reliant on medicines, travelling musicians like myself and everyone apart from the large but minority cohort of 50 plus tabloid engendered irrationality addicts  (I‚Äôll avoid the meat-related cliche) will breathe a sigh of relief. 

Then comes the election. Johnson will lay claim to the title of national saviour, the Brexit Party and DUP will scream ‚Äòbetrayal‚Äô but probably won‚Äôt stand against him despite everything they have said for fear of splitting the vote and letting JC in, and aided by the mainstream media a lot of people will give Johnson credit for ‚Äòdelivering Brexit‚Äô.  

That is where I predict we‚Äôll end up in a few weeks. I may well be wrong, of course, but having weighed up all the alternatives, there you are. 

Whether it is this scenario or virtually any other, though, it is my ABSOLUTE CONVICTION that if the anti Johnson vote is split between Labour, Greens, Lib Dem‚Äôs, Plaid and Scottish Nats JOHNSON WILL WIN. His entire strategy is facing a divided opposition. In order to defeat him the opposition must pursue the same strategy in the country as they just have in Parliament and stand ONE candidate against the Tories in every seat. 

To those who say the Lib Dem‚Äôs are a bunch of untrustworthy, opportunistic con artists I say I fully agree. But I‚Äôd rather be in coalition with Arfur Daley than be governed by Oswald Mosley. 

Mark my words, if Johnson wins the next election we will have the most right wing government in our history. And those who put party loyalties before defeating that are, in my view, totally misguided. Conventional politics is over.",,,,2019-09-10T16:49:43+0000,2019-09-11T16:49:43+0000,John Charles Baine,0,999,0,99,https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=858321497896263
